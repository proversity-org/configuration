# Add the jenkins-worker label so that this jenkins master will work
# out-of-the-box for running most kinds of jobs.  This makes integration
# testing easier, and is easier for the openedx community.
jenkins_common_main_labels:
  - 'dsl-seed-runner'
  - 'backup-runner'
  - 'jenkins-worker'  # added this
